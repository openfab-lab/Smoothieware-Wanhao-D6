# this is a fork to customize MKS sbase and TFT32 screen for Openfab

I have this new card MKS SBASE for controling CNC, Laser or 3dprint.  
I would to replace the electronics of the lasersaur we have. I'm kind bored by the actual software, there is a new soft with new fonctions like raster but a lot of small things like manual control input or tag managment is missing now. And it was so much usefull. 

so I'm here actually now.
